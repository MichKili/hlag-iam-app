##Problem description
Bob wants to check and compare historical rates between EUR and USD. He also wants to be able to retrieve a list of all previous searches that he did in the past.
###Exercise
Create a Java application that provides two REST API endpoints and has a database connection to support Bobâ€™s requirements: \
1. First that will accept the date in format â€˜YYYY-MM-DDâ€™. The provided date should then be used to call \
   https://www.frankfurter.app/docs/ API to fetch data on the rate between EUR and USD on that particular date. \
   Following data has to be stored in the database:
* rate value between EUR and USD,
* date on which this rate was present,
* a timestamp of the search operation.
  The endpoint should return in the response only the value of the rate between EUR and USD on the provided date.
  The second endpoint should return a list of all historical searches.\
  It should return a list of objects containing the following properties:
* rate value between EUR and USD,
* date on which this rate was present,
* a timestamp.
  The list should be sorted by the rates dates.
  Anything else that is not specified can be decided on your own.
